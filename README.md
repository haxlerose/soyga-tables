# Soyga Tables

This Ruby script generates Soyga tables based on keywords provided by the user. Soyga tables are an intriguing aspect of esoteric studies, often linked with historical mysticism and the search for hidden knowledge from the Book of Soyga.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need Ruby installed on your machine. I used Ruby 3.3 when writing this code, but I'm not sure how far back it is compatible

## Usage

To generate a table, provide an argument:

```bash
ruby soyga_table.rb "keyword"
```

To generate multiple tables, provide multiple arguments:

```bash
ruby soyga_table.rb "first" "second"
```

To generate all of the original Soyga tables, don't provide any arguments:

```bash
ruby soyga_table.rb
```
